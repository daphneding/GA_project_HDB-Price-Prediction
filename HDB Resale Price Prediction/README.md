## Background

The Housing & Development Board (HDB) was set up on 1 February 1960, taking over from the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) which was set up by the British colonial government in 1927.

The main task of the HDB was to house the nation. From just 9% of people living in government flats in 1960, HDB flats today house over 80% of Singaporeâ€™s population. ([Source](https://dollarsandsense.sg/5-types-hdb-flats-not-longer-built-singapore/))

Many of the HDB flat owners purchase resale flats from the market instead of applying for new flats due to a number of constraints. In view of that, a good housing price prediction model provides a valuable tool for real estate agents, investors, and home buyers, providing insights into the current state of the housing market and helping to inform investment decisions.

For example, The "Singapore's Smarter Property Search" page [99.co](https://www.99.co/) released an instant property value calculation tool for their users:

This housing price prediction project aims to simulate an accurate and reliable model just like the one used by [99.co](https://www.99.co/) for valuation of a HDB resale flat. 

Linear Regression is used as it is an effective model to establish relationship between the resale price variable from explanatory variables associated with it. ([Source](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/linear-regression-for-machine-learning)) The model is trained using transaction data from 2012 to 2020 and will be evaluated using RMSE as the primary metric. 

## Problem Statement

The objective of the study is two folds:

- First, to create a prediction model that accurately predict house price with reasonable error margin.
- Second, to ensure that the model generalized well to perform equally well on the data points that it never sees before.

Aside, I hope to help realters and investors to understand which feature(s) are more crucial to determine the HDB resale price in Singapore.
